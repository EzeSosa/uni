<p align="center">
A REST API that allows students to register, log in and manage their courses, exams and inscriptions.

 ## About The Project

There are much self-management university applications for students. In fact, in our university we have one. However, it has the following troubles:
- Databases are not normalized, so queries are very slow.
- Once a course is finished, there is no way to get our exam grades and dates.

Inspired on that, I made a simple application that anyone can easily use to register their (and their friends) university courses, enroll to them and register their exams.

Of course this is only the backend, so it might be hard for non-system people to use. I'm not planning to do the front-end because I think the appication is simple enough to use with simple HTTP requests for programming or engineering students.
 ## Built With

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Spring](https://spring.io/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
 ## Usage

The application allows HTTP requests, so any HTTP client like Postman or Thunder Client is enough to start using it.

Also, HTTP requests can be done through the [Swagger documentation](https://github.com/EzeSosa/uni/tree/feature/swagger-documentation) branch.

 ## Why?

The application is very simple, almost as simple to don't even bother to create a Git repository. The reason I made the application is merely for learning Kotlin language, which led to a bunch of new acknoledgement for me. I want to use it to express and remember good practices, certain problem-solving and object-oriented programming.
